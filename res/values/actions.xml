	Guidelines for actions
	
	An action has to be associated with a number of ticks.
	This is the number of ticks it takes to perform the action.
	
	The format of an action will be:
	<item>A_ACTION_NAME ticks</item>
	
	Example:
	<item>A_DUMMY_ACTION 10</item>
	
	Notes:
	* Actions names are all caps with no spaces. 
	* The name should start with A_ to identify it as an action.
	* The name and the number of ticks to perform the action are separated
		by a single space.
